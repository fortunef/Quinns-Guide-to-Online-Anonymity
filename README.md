# Quinns-Guide-to-Online-Anonymity
## Recommended mobile operating systems
### Android based: 
-   [**GrapheneOS**](https://grapheneos.org/) Formerly known as CopperheadOS is a FLOSS privacy focused Operating System that's a replacement for all the nonfree services included in Google's, Google Pixel Devices.
-   [**CalyxOS**](https://calyxos.org/) A open-sourced privacy focused Operating System with a UI similar to a Google Pixel comes with mostly free and open-sourced software pre-installed.
-   [**DivestOS**](https://divestos.org/) A free and open-sourced that's FOSS focused. Based off of [**LineageOS**](https://lineageos.org/).
### Linux Based:
-   [**PureOS**](https://www.pureos.net/) A free and open-sourced Operating System. It's FSF approved and it utilised the GNU's Linux Libre kernel. It's Debian Stable based I think. It comes with GNU CoreUtils
-   [**postmarketOS**](https://postmarketos.org/) A unique free Operating System. Based off of [**Alphine Linux**](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) so I'm not quite sure if it has GNU CoreUtils
## Recommended Desktop operating systems
### (GNU+)Linux(-Libre)-based distros:
-   [**NixOS Unstable (24.05)**](https://nixos.org/) This is the operating system that I personally utilise as my daily driver and i'm using it right now to type this out. NixOS is an easily reproducable, independent, immutable, general purpose, and fast operating system. It has the most packages in a Linux distro/Package Manager/MacOS Package Manager infront of the AUR. By default, it doesn't come with any nonfree software or any bloat either. This distrobution of the GNU/Linux operating system is based around the Nix package manager aka. the best package manager in the world. Theres 2 stable updates per year. The way you configure your whole system is within one file (/etc/nixos/configuration.nix) you can start & install services, packages, from that one file. It's sorta easy to learn atleast for me because I'm autistic but I digress.
  
-   [**Arch Linux**](https://archlinux.org/) A hard to install, easy to use, lightweight GNU/Linux operating system. It comes with a traditional package manager (pacman) to install software from the official repos. This distro is very hard to install because you have to install it using a CLI so you'll probably need a pair of programmming socks for this but once you've installed it, it's pretty simple. The main feature of this distro is the AUR (Arch User Repository) which is where anyone can upload anything to there. This brings alot of freedom but security issues aswell but in my time using Arch Linux, I've never gotten malware from there.
 
-   [**Fedora Silverblue**](https://fedoraproject.org/silverblue/) A ton of people call this distro the best immutable distrobution ever. I've never tried it but it looks like it's very secure and stable

## Recommended browsers
### Chromium Based:
-   [**Brave**](https://brave.com/) I wouldn't recommend this because of how bloated it is. It has weird cryptocurrency shinnanagins. But it's open-source and you can ignore all that. 
-   [**Bromite**](https://www.bromite.org/) Android only. Free and open-sourced with a UI almost exactly like Chromium and comes with an ad-blocker.
-   [**ungoogled-chromium**](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium) Completely blocks anything related to Google. Unlike Chromium, ungoogled-chromium doesnt call home to Google. Fully free.
### Firefox Based:
-   [**Firefox (w/user.js)**](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) Link goes to Firefox. Link to a user.js (arkenfox) [**here**](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/). Both free and open-sourced and the user.js you can modify to the amount of privacy and anonymity you yearn for. Can't be done on IOS and Android.
-   [**GNUzilla and IceCat**](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/) FSF Approved Browser. Blocks all nonfree and nontrivial Javascript which causes some sites to not work like Youtube but you can use privacy-focused front-ends for them like [**Invidious**](https://invidious.io/) (Youtube).
-   [**LibreWolf**](https://librewolf.net/) uBlock Origin pre-installed. Independent Fork of Firefox
-   [**Mull**](https://f-droid.org/packages/us.spotco.fennec_dos/) Android only. It is Firefox w/arkenfox-user.js but for Android.
-   [**Tor**](https://www.torproject.org/download/) Most secure out of all of these but with the sacrifice of convience. Community ran. Runs your network traffic through 3 nodes. **❗❗DO NOT USE TOR WITH A VPN❗❗**
-   [**Mullvad Browser**](https://mullvad.net/en/download/browser/linux) Not to be confused with Mull, Mullvad Browser is a browser made as a collaboration with Mullvad and the Tor Project. It's the second most private browser out of there and it's designed to be used with a VPN (specifically Mullvad VPN). Unlike Tor, most sites don't block Mullvad Browser so I personally use it.
## Browser tests
**❗❗MAKE SURE YOUR BROWSER YOUR USER AGENT WHATEVER ISNT TOO UNIQUE BECAUSE IF IT IS THEN ITLL BE EASIER TO TRACE YOUR ACTIVITY. BLEND IN, NOT STAND OUT THATS THE REASON WHY TOR AND MULLVAD BROWSER EXISTS❗❗**
-   https://www.deviceinfo.me I recommend this one
-   https://dnsleaktest.comhttps://mullvad.net/en/download/browser/linux
-   https://librespeed.org
-   https://privacytests.org
-   https://time.gov
-   https://mullvad.net/en/check and this one too
## Privacy friendly front-ends
-   https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/Privacy_friendly_frontends # Haha funny 4chan.org/g/ board website
## Recommended search engines
-   [**Brave Search**](https://search.brave.com/) Can be used without the Brave browser. Completely uncensored. Completely independent.
-   [**Duckduckgo**](https://duckduckgo.com) Basically a privacy front-end for Bing since it gets its results from Bing.
-   [**SearX/SearXNG**](https://searx.space/) You can self-host this if you're ultra paranoid. You can index results from multiple search engines and websites like Google, Bing, Yandex, Github, Wikidata etc.
-   [**Startpage**](https://www.startpage.com/) Gets its results from Google. Ran by an advertising company if that's a concern.
## Privacy oriented DNS
~~-   [**AdGuard**](https://adguard-dns.io/en/welcome.html)~~
~~[**NextDNS**](https://nextdns.io)~~
~~[**Quad9**](https://www.quad9.net/)~~

**❗❗DO NOT USE FOR THEY ARE FREE AND IN CAPITALISM, IF SOMETHING IS FREE YOU ARE 9 OUT of 10 TIMES THE PRODUCT AND THE ADVERTSERS THE CUSTOMERS INSTEAD JUST PAY FOR A VPN LIKE MULLVAD OR PROTON VPN WHICH HAS THERE OWN DNS AND THEIR CLIENTS ARE BOTH OPEN SOURCE❗❗**
## Privacy oriented email
-   [**ProtonMail**](https://proton.me/mail) Emails automatically PGP encrypted when communicating with other Proton Mail users for convience. I'd recommend paying for this one instead of the free tier because you get a VPN, (I'd recommend Mullvad VPN because it's pay as you go [I havent paid for Mullvad VPN for like half of the year]) Cloud storage (The cloud is just someone elses computer remember that), Email Aliases, and some other stuff.
-   [**Tutanota**](https://tutanota.com/) Emails automatically PGP encrypted when communicating with other Tutanota users for convience.
## Recommended Instant Messenger
-   [**Signal**](https://www.signal.org/)
## BIOS/UEFI replacement (For the serverly paranoid power users)
-   [**coreboot**](https://coreboot.org)
-   [**Libreboot**](https://libreboot.org)

    **❗❗WARNING THIS MAY BRICK YOUR COMPUTER IF POSSIBLE BUY A LAPTOP OR A MOTHERBOARD WITH COREBOOT/LIBREBOOT PREINSTALLED❗❗**
