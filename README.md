# Quinns-Guide-to-Online-Anonymity
## Recommended mobile operating systems
### Android based: 
-   [**GrapheneOS**](https://grapheneos.org/) A free and open-sourced privacy focused Operating System, formerly known as CopperheadOS.
-   [**CalyxOS**](https://calyxos.org/) A open-sourced privacy focused Operating System with a UI similar to a Google Pixel comes with mostly free and open-sourced software pre-installed.
-   [**DivestOS**](https://divestos.org/) A free and open-sourced that's FOSS focused. Based off of [**LineageOS**](https://lineageos.org/).
### Linux Based:
-   [**PureOS**](https://www.pureos.net/) A free and open-sourced Operating System. The UI is similar to older Samsung Phones.
-   [**postmarketOS**](https://postmarketos.org/) A unique free and open-sourced Operating System. Based off of [**Alphine Linux**](https://www.alpinelinux.org/).
## Recommended browsers
### Chromium Based:
-   [**Brave**](https://brave.com/) A free and open-sourced browser with a built in ad and tracker blocker, with their own privacy-respecting search engine. Easy to switch to from Chrome.
-   [**Bromite**](https://www.bromite.org/) Android only. Free and open-sourced with a UI almost exactly like Chrome and comes with an ad-blocker.
-   [**ungoogled-chrome**](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium) Completely blocks anything related to Google. Free and open-sourced.
### Firefox Based:
-   [**Firefox (w/user.js)**](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) Link goes to Firefox. Link to a user.js (arkenfox) [**here**](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/). Both free and open-sourced and the user.js you can modify to the amount of privacy and anonymity you yearn for. Can't be done on IOS and Android.
-   [**GNUzilla and IceCat**](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/) Blocks all non-FOSS types of Javascript which causes some sites to not work like Youtube but you can use privacy-focused front-ends for them like [**Invidious**](https://invidious.io/) (Youtube).
-   [**LibreWolf**](https://librewolf.net/) uBlock Origin included. Basically Firefox w/user.js but a bit more convient to install and with more features.
-   [**Mull**](https://f-droid.org/packages/us.spotco.fennec_dos/) Android only. It is Firefox w/arkenfox-user.js but for Android.
-   [**Tor**](https://www.torproject.org/download/) Most secure out of all of these but with the sacrifice of convience. Community ran. Runs your network traffic through 3 nodes. I would recommend using it with Mullvad VPN not any other VPN since they don't have a proven no-log policy.
